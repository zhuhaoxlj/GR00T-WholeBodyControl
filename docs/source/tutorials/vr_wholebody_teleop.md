# PICO VR Whole-body Teleop 

Full whole-body teleoperation using PICO VR headset and controllers. To teleop, use the option  `--input-type zmq_manager` during deployment. The `zmq_manager` input type switches between a **planner mode** (locomotion commands via ZMQ) and a **streamed motion mode** (full-body SMPL poses from PICO).

```{admonition} Isaac Teleop / CloudXR Scope
:class: note
The same `zmq_manager` workflow can also drive the headset through Isaac Teleop / CloudXR by launching `gear_sonic/scripts/pico_manager_thread_server.py --input-source isaac-teleop`. The streamer hosts the CloudXR runtime in-process via `isaacteleop[cloudxr]` — no separate publisher container required. That path is currently supported only for **G1 with a Thor backpack**; a regular G1 setup is not supported yet.
```

```{admonition} Safety Warning
:class: danger
Whole-body teleoperation involves fast, agile motions. **Always** maintain a clear safety zone and keep a safety operator at the keyboard ready to trigger an emergency stop (**`O`** in the C++ terminal, or **A+B+X+Y** on the PICO controllers).

You **must wear tight-fitting pants or leggings** to guarantee line-of-sight for the foot trackers — loose or baggy clothing can make tracking fail unpredictably and may result in dangerous motion.

## Prerequisites

1. **Completed the [Quick Start](../getting_started/quickstart.md)** — you can run the sim2sim loop (includes [installing the deployment](../getting_started/installation_deploy.md) and [downloading model checkpoints](../getting_started/download_models.md)).
2. **Completed the [VR Teleop Setup](../getting_started/vr_teleop_setup.md)** — `.venv_teleop` is ready. For the default path, PICO hardware is installed, calibrated, and connected. For Isaac Teleop / CloudXR, the `isaacteleop[cloudxr]` package is also installed (handled by `install_pico.sh`) and the headset connects to the in-process CloudXR runtime — see [Isaac Teleop Setup](isaac_teleop_publisher_setup.md).

## Step-by-Step: Teleop in SIM

Run **three terminals** to teleoperate the simulated robot.

### Terminal 1 — Launch virtual robot in MuJoCo Simulator

From the **repo root**:

```bash
# bash install_scripts/install_pico.sh

source .venv_teleop/bin/activate
python gear_sonic/scripts/run_sim_loop.py
```

### Terminal 2 — C++ Deployment

From `gear_sonic_deploy/`:

```bash
cd gear_sonic_deploy
source scripts/setup_env.sh
./deploy.sh --input-type zmq_manager sim
# Wait until you see "Init done"
```

**Isaac Teleop / CloudXR alternative** (**G1 + Thor backpack only**) — run the C++ deployment from the project's ROS2 docker container instead of bare metal:

```bash
cd gear_sonic_deploy
export TensorRT_ROOT=$HOME/TensorRT   # only if not already in ~/.bashrc
./docker/run-ros2-dev.sh

# inside the container (setup_env.sh is sourced automatically):
just build                                  # first run only
./deploy.sh --input-type zmq_manager sim
# Wait until you see "Init done"
```

See [Installation (Deployment) → Docker (ROS2 Development Environment)](../getting_started/installation_deploy.md) for details on `run-ros2-dev.sh` and `TensorRT_ROOT`.

```{note}
The `--zmq-host` flag defaults to `localhost`, which is correct when both C++ deployment scripts and teleop scripts (Terminal 3) run on the same machine. If the teleop script runs on a different machine, pass `--zmq-host <IP-of-teleop-machine>`.
```

### Terminal 3 — PICO Teleop Streamer

From the **repo root**:

```bash
source .venv_teleop/bin/activate

# With full visualization (recommended for first run):
python gear_sonic/scripts/pico_manager_thread_server.py --manager \
    --vis_vr3pt --vis_smpl

# Without visualization (for headless / onboard practice):
# python gear_sonic/scripts/pico_manager_thread_server.py --manager
```

**Isaac Teleop / CloudXR alternative** (**G1 + Thor backpack only**) — connects the headset over CloudXR (no XRoboToolKit PC service required); the streamer launches the CloudXR runtime in-process via `isaacteleop[cloudxr]`:

```bash
source .venv_teleop/bin/activate

python gear_sonic/scripts/pico_manager_thread_server.py --manager \
    --input-source isaac-teleop

# If running offboard with a display, add visualization:
#   --vis_vr3pt --vis_smpl
```

When you turn on the visualization, wait for a window to pop up showing a Unitree G1 mesh with all joints at the default angles. If no window shows up on the default PICO path, double-check the PICO's XRoboToolKit IP configuration in the [VR Teleop Setup](../getting_started/vr_teleop_setup.md). If you are using Isaac Teleop instead, verify the headset is connected to the in-process CloudXR runtime — see [Isaac Teleop Setup](isaac_teleop_publisher_setup.md) for connection steps.

### Your First Teleop Session

1. **Assume the calibration pose** — stand upright, feet together, upper arms at your sides, forearms bent 90° forward (L-shape at each elbow), palms inward. See [Calibration Pose](#calibration-pose) for details.
2. Press **A + B + X + Y** simultaneously to engage the control policy and run the initial full calibration (`CALIB_FULL`).
3. Align your arms with the robot's current pose, then press **A + X** to enter full-body SMPL teleop (**POSE** mode). Move your arms and legs — the robot follows.
4. Press **A + X** again to fall back to **PLANNER** (idle) mode.
5. Press **A + B + X + Y** again to stop the robot.

### Modes & Calibration

The system has **4 operating modes** and **2 calibration types**.

**Modes:**

| Mode | Encoder | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **OFF** | -- | Policy not running. Stand in [calibration pose](#calibration-pose), then press **A+B+X+Y** to start policy. |
| **POSE** | SMPL | Whole-body teleop — streaming the SMPL pose from PICO to the C++ deployment side. Your motion will directly map to the robot .|
| **PLANNER** | G1 | Locomotion planner active; upper body controller by planner. Joysticks control direction and heading in walking and running modes. |
| **PLANNER_FROZEN_UPPER** | G1 | Planner locomotion; upper body frozen at last POSE snapshot. |
| **VR_3PT** | TELEOP | Planner locomotion; upper body follows VR 3-point tracking (head + 2 hands). Depends on non-IK-based VR 3-point calibration. |

**Calibration types** (non-IK workflow for minimal latency):

| Type | What Is Calibrated | When Triggered |
|---|---|---|
| **CALIB_FULL** | Head + both wrists against **all-zero** reference pose. | Once on first **A+B+X+Y** (startup). |
| **CALIB** | Both wrists only against the **current robot pose**. | Each switch into VR_3PT via **Left Stick Click**. |

### State Machine

There are 4 modes and 2 control chains. Each chain forms a triangle: **A+X** (or **B+Y**) returns to POSE from *both* the planner node and its VR_3PT sub-mode.

```text
  ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  A+B+X+Y (any mode) ──► OFF          │
  └──────────────────────────────────────┘

  Startup:
    OFF ──(A+B+X+Y)──► PLANNER ──(A+X)──► POSE
          CALIB_FULL

  Chain 1 — G1 encoder listens to planner-generated full-body motion: PLANNER

    PLANNER ─── L-Stick (+CALIB) ──► VR_3PT
     ▲    │ ◄─────── L-Stick ─────────  │
     │    │                             │

     │    ▼                             ▼
     └─ POSE ◄──────────────────────────┘

  Chain 2 — G1 encoder listens to planner-generated lower-body motion: PLANNER_FROZEN_UPPER

    PLANNER_FROZEN_UPPER ── L-Stick (+CALIB) ──► VR_3PT
         ▲     │ ◄──────── L-Stick ──────────     │
         │     │                                  │

         │     ▼                                  ▼
         └── POSE ◄───────────────────────────────┘
```

```{admonition} DANGER — Mode-Switching Safety
:class: danger
**Before switching into POSE or VR_3PT**, always align your body with the robot's current pose first!!

- **POSE:** The robot instantly snaps to your physical pose. A large mismatch causes sudden, aggressive motion.
- **VR_3PT:** A misaligned calibration produces erratic, dangerous motion as soon as you move your arms. Check more info at section [per-switch-calib](#per-switch-calib)
```

### VR_3PT Calibration Hint

The `VR_3PT` mode depends on accurate calibration. Two calibration events occur:

#### One-time `CALIB_FULL` (head + wrists)

Before pressing **A + B + X + Y** for the first time, you **must** stand in the robot's **all-zero reference pose**. The system captures your PICO body-tracking frame as the zero-reference for all subsequent motion mapping.

**The reference pose:**
1. **Stand upright**, feet together, looking straight forward.
2. **Upper arms** hang straight down, close to your torso.
3. **Forearms** bent 90° forward (L-shape at each elbow), palms facing inward.

```{tip}
Launch the teleop script with `--vis_vr3pt` to see the robot's reference pose in a visualization window. Match your body to it before pressing the start combo.
```

(per-switch-calib)=
#### Per-switch `CALIB` (wrists only)

Each time you enter `VR_3PT` via **Left Stick Click**, the system re-calibrates both wrists against the robot's **current** pose. Always align your arms with the robot before clicking.

Below is an example of **bad calibration practice** — transitioning into VR_3PT without aligning your arms to the robot's current pose. The robot may not jump immediately, but will exhibit erratic and dangerous motion as soon as you move.

```{admonition} DANGER — Mode-Switching Safety
:class: danger
**Before switching into POSE or VR_3PT**, always align your body with the robot's current pose first.

**Recovery from bad VR_3PT calibration:**
1. Freeze the upper body — switch back via **Left Stick Click**.
2. Re-align your arms with the robot's current (possibly distorted) pose.
3. Switch to **POSE** mode (**A+X**) to reset.
```

Below is the **recovery procedure** — if you accidentally enter a badly calibrated VR_3PT state, freeze the upper body (Left Stick Click back), then switch to POSE mode (A+X) to reset safely.

## Step-by-Step: Teleop on Real Robot

```{admonition} Safety Warning
:class: danger
Only proceed once you can smoothly control the robot in simulation and are comfortable with emergency stops. **Terminate any running `run_sim_loop.py` process first** — simultaneous sim and real instances will conflict.
```

The real-robot workflow uses **two terminals** (no MuJoCo simulator).

### Terminal 1 — C++ Deployment (Real Robot)

From `gear_sonic_deploy/`:

```bash
cd gear_sonic_deploy
source scripts/setup_env.sh

# 'real' auto-detects the robot network interface (192.168.123.x).
# If auto-detection fails, pass the G1's IP directly:
#   ./deploy.sh --input-type zmq_manager <G1-IP>
./deploy.sh --input-type zmq_manager real

# Wait until you see "Init done"
```

**Isaac Teleop / CloudXR alternative** (**G1 + Thor backpack only**) — run the C++ deployment from the project's ROS2 docker container instead of bare metal:

```bash
cd gear_sonic_deploy
export TensorRT_ROOT=$HOME/TensorRT   # only if not already in ~/.bashrc
./docker/run-ros2-dev.sh

# inside the container (setup_env.sh is sourced automatically):
just build                                   # first run only
./deploy.sh --input-type zmq_manager real
# Wait until you see "Init done"
```

```{note}
If the teleop script (Terminal 2) runs on a different machine, add `--zmq-host <IP-of-teleop-machine>` so the C++ side knows where the ZMQ publisher is.
```

### Terminal 2 — PICO Teleop Streamer

From the **repo root**:

```bash
# bash install_scripts/install_pico.sh

source .venv_teleop/bin/activate
python gear_sonic/scripts/pico_manager_thread_server.py --manager

# If running offboard with a display, add visualization:
#   --vis_vr3pt --vis_smpl
```

**Isaac Teleop / CloudXR alternative** (**G1 + Thor backpack only**) — in-process CloudXR runtime via `isaacteleop[cloudxr]`, no XRoboToolKit PC service required:

```bash
source .venv_teleop/bin/activate
python gear_sonic/scripts/pico_manager_thread_server.py --manager --input-source isaac-teleop
```

```{note}
Update the IP in the PICO's XRoboToolKit app to match this machine before starting the default PICO path. For Isaac Teleop, make sure the headset is connected to the in-process CloudXR runtime — see [Isaac Teleop Setup](isaac_teleop_publisher_setup.md).
```

Follow the same start sequence: calibration pose → **A+B+X+Y** → **A+X** for POSE mode. See [Complete PICO Controls](#pico-controls) for all available commands.
